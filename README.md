# Something 1.3.4 - SOMETHING

Difficult rundown rewarding good aim. Team of 4 highly recommended. Most levels are designed to be relatively short (30-60 mins) but intense (smooth, dynamic gameplay), pithy (lots of resources) and satisfying (the balance we needed). Most weapons slightly buffed. No annoying locks on boxes. Level difficulty and recommended gear given in every level description. Play it at your own risk.

My first rundown btw, I'd appreciate any feedback so feel free to add me and tell me what you think :) my discord: maxinho
